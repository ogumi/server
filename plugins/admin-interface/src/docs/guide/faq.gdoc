h4. Why should I use this instead of "scaffolding"?
The scaffolding is better as a code-generation tool that "bootstrap" a new application with a base
application. The aim of the plugin is to provide a customizable backend to extend the administration.

We don't want to override scaffolding but to use this configuration-based alternative.

Also, this plugin has some other added features such as:

* Integrated with security
* Configurables views
* Integrates easily as a plugin
